This is the SQL code, I used to query questions in a database about netflix movies.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

SELECT MAX(date_added)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS nt
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS np
ON nt.show_id=np.show_id
where title='Bright Star';

select title, min(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1; 

/* questions */
How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
