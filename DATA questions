This is the SQL code, I used to query questions in a database about netflix movies.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

SELECT MAX(date_added)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS nt
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS np
ON nt.show_id=np.show_id
where title='Bright Star';

select title, min(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1; 

/* questions */
